Follow these steps in order to test changes in the post-receive hook without a lot of bogus commits.

    cd <remote/bare repository>
    git log -2 --format=oneline --reverse

The command above will produce the latest two commits from the repository. Use them to replace *$FROM_ID* and *$TO_ID* below:

    echo "$FROM_ID $TO_ID master" | ./hooks/post-receiv

This makes post-receive hooks really enjoyable, and you may execute this command repeatedly.
