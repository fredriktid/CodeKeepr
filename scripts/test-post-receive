Follow these steps in order to test changes in the post-receive hook while avoiding to pollude the repo history with  
test/bogus commits.

1. The command below will produce the two lastest commits from the "bare" repository. Make a note of the hashes.

    cd <remote repository>
    git log -2 --format=oneline --reverse

2. Replace $FROM_ID and $TO_ID in the following command with the hashes from step 1, enabling you to quickly iterate 
on your script and execute it repeatedly.

    echo "$FROM_ID $TO_ID master" | ./hooks/post-receive

Working with git can be really enjoyable at times.
